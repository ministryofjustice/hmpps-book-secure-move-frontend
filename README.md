This is the rendering application for the Book a secure move service.

Book a secure move is part of the HMPPS Prisoner Escort and Custody
Service (PECS) programme.

## Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 12)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (>= 6.7.0)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (>= 5.0.5)

## Installation

1. Clone repository and change directory:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-book-secure-move-frontend && cd hmpps-book-secure-move-frontend
   ```

1. Install node dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

1. Build the assets

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

## Configuring the application

Create a copy of the example environment variable file and add values for the keys:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

Set the [environment variables](#environment-variables) accordingly.

## Running the application

### In production mode

```
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

The app will run on port 3000 by default and be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### In development mode

Ensure Redis is installed and running.

```
npm run develop
```

The app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or with browsersync at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

#### Running with debugging

Some extra levels of debugging have been added to aid development.

To see all axios requests/responses run:

```
DEBUG=axios npm run develop
```

To see app level debug logs run:

```
DEBUG=app:* npm run develop
```

You can combine namespaces, for example:

```
DEBUG=axios,app:* npm run develop
```

## Testing and linting

### Unit tests

Unit tests are run using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework and the [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) library for assertions.

It also includes the [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) library for test spies, stubs and mocks.

To check unit tests results:

```
npm test
```

To watch unit tests whilst developing:

```
npm run watch:test
```

### Acceptance tests

Acceptance (end-to-end) tests run using [TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/) framework
and configured in CircleCI to run against `$E2E_BASE_URL` variable (staging) when the app is merged to
`master` and deployed to staging.

To run the CI tests locally run:

```
npm run test-e2e:ci
```

To debug tests on local server run:

```
npm run test-e2e:local
```

And to run test in specific browser run: `test-e2e:chrome` or `test-e2e:firefox`.

The video recording of each test is stored in artifacts/video directory and is stored on CI under artifacts for review.

### Code coverage

Code coverage is provided by Istanbul's command line tool, [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc).

To see coverage reports run:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

To open the results in a browser after running use:

```bash
npm run coverage:open
```

### Linting

#### JavaScript

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is used to lint JavaScript code and keep a consistent standard in the way it is written within this project.

The config uses the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) style as a base with [some custom tweaks](./.eslintrc.js).

[Prettifier](https://prettier.io) is also used to extend eslint to add some extra rules
around how files are formatted. It can be [integrated to many popular editors](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
to help with formatting on save.

To check linting results run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

#### Commit messages

[Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) is used to lint commit messages to ensure they conform to [conventional convention](https://commitlint.js.org/#/concepts-commit-conventions).

This convention is required to automate the generation of changelogs and release notes on GitHub during the [release process](#releases-and-deployment).

## Releases and deployment

Releases and changelogs are automatically generated using [standard-version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version). To generate a new release run:

```bash
npm run release
```

This will:

- update contributors in `package.json`
- increase the version in `package.json` based on commits since last tag
- create a new changelog entry
- create a version commit
- create a new git tag
- push commit and tags to remote

It will also start a new deployment specific [job on CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/github/ministryofjustice/hmpps-book-secure-move-frontend/pipelines) which will run the full suite of automated tests and create a [release on GitHub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-book-secure-move-frontend/releases).

**Note:** The deployment job has a [manual approval](https://circleci.com/blog/supporting-digital-transformation-while-avoiding-common-stalls/) step before it will release that version to production.
